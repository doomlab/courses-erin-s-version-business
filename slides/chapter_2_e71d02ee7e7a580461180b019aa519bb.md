In the previous set of exercises, you learned how to plan for retirement using real dollar amounts. Here, we are going to extend to nominal dollar calculations.

## Nominal Dollars

```yaml

```

`@part1`
Real dollar planning assumes uniform stock returns

Nominal dollar planning incorporates a security horizon

Model will sell enough stock to maintain expenses through the security horizon


`@script`
When we previously planned for retirement, we focused on creating model that assumed the same return on our stocks across years. In reality, we know that the stock market can be volatile, so we can consider planning in nominal dollar amounts. This model includes a security horizon, which is 10 to 15 year period of safe investments to withdraw money from when the stock market is poor.

## Fixed Information

Hey a picture here of the sheet.


`@script`
First, create a sheet with all the fixed information for the model, including: returned on our income, return on stocks, ordinary tax rate, capital gains tax rates, inflation rates, initial balance, initial withdrawal, and security horizon. These numbers are our best guess for the variables that impact retirement planning. After we are finished creating our model plan, these values can be adjusted to plan for different retirement scenarios.
